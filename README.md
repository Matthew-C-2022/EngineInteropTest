# EngineInteropTest


This is quite a simple (And poor) example of an interop system inspired by S&box, I have only used functions unlike s&box which transfers structs as well. The functions work fine and this can EASILY be expanded upon, I only did this to learn how I could Hijack the system in s&box.
